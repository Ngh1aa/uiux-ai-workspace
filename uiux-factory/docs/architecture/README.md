## Current architecture statement

A4 runtime consolidation remains in force. The single shared executable Flow OS owner is `uiux-factory/core/runtime/flow_os/`. `skills_UIUX/` remains the declarative owner for skills, flows, policies, schemas, runtime policy and reusable Knowledge OS metadata/content. Python modules under `skills_UIUX/runtime/` are compatibility shims, not an independent runtime.

The full Factory product lifecycle remains under `uiux-factory/run.py` + `core/manager/`; the provider-neutral managed CLI uses the same canonical Flow OS through `skills_UIUX/scripts/uiux-agent.py`.

## Brain OS boundary

Brain OS under `uiux-factory/core/brain_os/` is a bounded reasoning/control layer. It adds typed contracts, adapters, critique, repair proposals, evidence relationships, semantic memory, scorecard aggregation and deterministic knowledge retrieval above canonical runtime/evidence/evaluation owners. It is not a third execution runtime.

## Evidence / evaluation truth

Canonical evidence truth remains owned by `core/runtime/flow_os/evidence.py`, `core/provenance/`, and `uiux-factory/qa/`. Canonical terminal runtime evaluation remains owned by `core/evaluation/run_evaluator.py`. Brain surfaces may reference or aggregate those owners but cannot manufacture current truth or runtime PASS.

## Provider convergence boundary

A48 establishes controlled provider convergence. `ManagedArtifactCompletionAdapter` preserves Factory async `complete(...) -> str`; offline provider parity is benchmarked; `UIUX_FACTORY_PROVIDER_LANE=managed_compat` is explicit opt-in while `legacy` remains default. There is no automatic cross-lane fallback and provider-lane provenance has no evidence/gate/release authority.

Provider default migration remains a separate governance decision requiring stronger live-provider evidence.

## Lifecycle boundary

A49 uses the comparison vocabulary:

```text
INTAKE → INTERPRET → PLAN → RESEARCH → DESIGN → IMPLEMENT → QA → REPLAN → FINALIZE → RELEASE
```

The vocabulary and `LifecycleProjection` are read-only observability surfaces, not a third state machine. Factory completion does not imply production release; Managed completion does not imply worktree finalization or release. Unknown stages fail safe instead of being guessed.

## Knowledge OS boundary

The ownership split remains:

```text
SKILL     = procedural methodology / how to perform work
KNOWLEDGE = reusable domain/reference context
MEMORY    = project/run-specific rationale, hypotheses, decisions and history
EVIDENCE  = current provenance-bearing observed truth
```

Canonical owners:

```text
skills_UIUX/knowledge/                         declarative knowledge
skills_UIUX/knowledge/index.json              explicit canonical index
skills_UIUX/schemas/knowledge-*.schema.json   metadata/index contracts
core/brain_os/knowledge_retrieval.py          deterministic retrieval
core/brain_os/adapters/knowledge_context.py   post-routing context adapter
```

Retrieval runs only after a `FlowSelectionDecision` exists and a stage is known. It remains deterministic, context-bounded, provenance-bearing and vector-free.

All knowledge outputs remain:

```text
advisory_only = true
current_run_evidence = false
deterministic_metadata_first = true
vector_search_used = false
flow_effect = none
skill_activation_effect = none
authority_effect = none
gate_effect = none
evidence_effect = none
release_effect = none
```

### A50.3 canonical seed

The canonical index contains exactly three curated records:

```text
financial-services  → Unicode CLDR / UTS #35 number/currency reference
art-culture         → IIIF Presentation API 3.0 cultural-object metadata/rights reference
industrial-services → U.S. DOE Motor Systems repair/system-performance reference
```

The corpus is deliberately small. It stores concise paraphrased domain/reference context, not copied source articles and not skill procedures.

Main CI dogfoods retrieval against Nova, Lumen and CENNEXT. Each project must retrieve only its intended domain record while the other two records are excluded by `domain_mismatch`.

### A50.4 usefulness and corpus governance

A50.4 does not infer model reasoning improvement from deterministic retrieval. It evaluates separate proxies:

```text
actionable_delta
domain_specificity
skill_duplication_clear
retrieval_noise_clear
provenance_clear
context_budget_clear
```

Each current seed must satisfy every proxy to receive deterministic `KEEP`; otherwise it derives `REVISE`.

Allowed record decisions are only:

```text
KEEP
REVISE
REMOVE
```

`EXPAND` is deliberately absent and global `expand_allowed = false`. Deterministic checks can establish context fit, provenance, boundedness and low duplication/noise, but cannot establish model reasoning improvement or human usefulness. Corpus expansion therefore requires a separate human/model-assisted usefulness trial.

Benchmark scope remains:

```text
deterministic_context_usefulness_proxy_not_model_reasoning_or_product_evidence
```

## Regression and dogfood

Main UIUX Factory CI validates deterministic product/routing/repair/memory/scorecard/provider-parity/lifecycle-parity/knowledge-retrieval corpora, curated project retrieval dogfood and knowledge-usefulness governance before the full pytest suite. A20 continues full regression, structural/security audit and pinned Nova/Lumen/CENNEXT dogfood. A13 continues real Nova browser dogfood when path-triggered.

A50 regression covers source provenance, exact three-record seed governance, knowledge-vs-skill separation, cross-domain isolation, freshness, context budgets, traversal fail-closed behavior, post-routing flow immutability, usefulness proxy boundaries and the corpus-expansion block.

## Remaining architecture debt

1. Provider convergence has a controlled opt-in lane, but `legacy` remains default pending separate live-provider/governance evidence.
2. Lifecycle convergence remains intentionally read-only at the reconciliation/projection/parity layer; mutation-level unification requires a separate decision.
3. The three seed records have deterministic usefulness proxies only; no human/model-assisted with-vs-without trial has yet established that they materially improve reasoning/output quality.
4. Broader Knowledge OS categories remain intentionally unpopulated and corpus expansion is blocked.
5. Time-sensitive factual/regulatory claims still require current source verification; Knowledge OS does not replace research/evidence acquisition.
6. Vector/semantic retrieval remains deferred.

## Source-of-truth priority

When documents disagree:

1. current source and executable tests;
2. root `AGENTS.md`, runtime policy and `docs/CONTRACT-OWNERSHIP.md`;
3. this architecture truth set;
4. current capability/QA docs that match source;
5. historical A-series plans and implementation notes.

## Next architecture task

Proceed to **A50.5 — Human/Model-Assisted Knowledge Value Trial** only after A50.4 is green and merged. Compare representative outputs with vs without retrieved knowledge under the same task/flow context, record human usefulness judgments separately from deterministic metrics, and only then consider an `EXPAND` recommendation. Vector search remains deferred.
